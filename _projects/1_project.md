Liquid-based materials are very attractive, one of the technologies to build liquid-based materials is liquid gating technology. “Liquid Gating Technology” was selected as the 2020 “Top Ten Emerging Technologies in Chemistry” by International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, IUPAC. The liquid gating technology is used for breaking through the limitation of the solid-based materials, because liquid gating technology can endow the materials with both soft (liquid phase) and hard (solid phase) parts with different functions as the liquid-based materials, which have a dynamic response to external stimulus. Liquid gating technology could also provide the new strategies to convert the basic scientific issues of membrane materials from the solid-liquid/solid-gas interface to the liquid-liquid/liquid-gas interface, which would bring more possibilities to the design of the smart functional systems in the application of water treatment, chemical detection, environmental science, energy, and other interdisciplinary fields.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
