Structures from Nature have remarkable properties, many of which have inspired laboratory research. Bioinspired materials and devices are attracting increasing interest because of their unique properties, which have paved the way for many significant applications. For example, ion channels that exist in living organisms play important roles in maintaining normal physiological conditions and serve as “smart” gates to ensure selective ion transport. Normal body function depends strongly on the regulation of ion transport inside these nanochannels. Thus, designing a system that simulates these complex processes in living systems is a challenging task for nanoscience and biotechnology. Nature brings us endless bioinspired physicochemical ideas to better the development of novel artificial materials and micro/nano devices that enable us to potentially overcome these obstacles. Bioinspired approaches owe much of their current development in biology, chemistry, materials science, medicine, energy, and engineering to the design and fabrication of advanced devices.
